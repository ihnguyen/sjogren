# Evaluation of Sj&ouml;gren's Syndrome Prevalence and Incidence in Adult U.S. Population from Administrative Health Claims Data

Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease that causes symptoms such as dry eyes, dry mouth, etc.
It is estimated by the Sj&ouml;gren Foundation that approximately 4 million people suffer from this disease.
With the low diagnosis rate of Sj&ouml;gren syndrome, the foundation and epidemiologists have made efforts to understand the disease.
Evaluating the disease's prevalence and incidence is a step forward at learning more about the disease burden.

The following study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence and incidence of Sj&ouml;gren's Syndrome diagnosis in U.S. adult population using commercial and medicare administrative health claims data.

Results:

The observational study shows that middle aged women are the target population of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome. It is recommended for women to test for Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome before they reach middle age as it can help mitigate the risk of developing this rare autoimmune diease.
